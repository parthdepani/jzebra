= Introduction =
If you are looking to send raw printer commands to your printer with php, jsp, ASP or JavaScript you likely have found -- until now -- the only option is a proprietary Microsoft-only ActiveX control for Internet Explorer.  jZebra is an open-source and open-API alternative.  Version 1.0.3 and higher features an in-browser applet written in Java that can work with multiple web browsers including Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, Firefox, Chrome. If the printer is NOT a Zebra printer, jZebra may still work for your application.


= Details =
jZebra sends raw information to your printer by bypassing the standard PCL (printer control language) and sending raw data directly to your printer.  In the production industry, this raw printing functionality is often required for making badges (RFID, magnetic strip) and labels (bar-codes, asset tags) from Zebra printers.  jZebra may work with non-zebra printers too.


= API/License =
jZebra is an open-source Java application using open Java APIs.  jZebra is licensed GPL 3+ which allows it to be used without modification in open source, closed source and even be sold with a product.  If you modify the source code of jZebra, you need to publish your changes in accordance with the GPL 3+ license.

jZebra can be included in your Java projects directly, or loaded as a web applet.  Batch-mode printing is under development.

Zebra™ printing is the most common use of jZebra due to the growing demand for a web page that can perform thermal/bar-code or magnetic-stripe printing.  

Since its creation, jZebra has shown more interest in its capabilities in printing bar-codes for shipping purposes.  Not to be confused with the [http://barbecue.sourceforge.net Barbecue]  project...
