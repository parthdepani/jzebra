jZebra has been in development since 2008 and exists solely because of the rich community of developers that show support for the project.  As more and more businesses have a need for browser-based printing -- especially in the shipping and retail industry -- a need for thermal printing via web page is demanded more each day.  jZebra offers this for free!

Donations are not mandatory, and you can donate without spending money by offering code or help through the wiki or mailing list.

If you find jZebra beneficial (or profitable) please consider contributing back to the project.  jZebra was not created to make money.  Development costs for jZebra are minimal thanks to other "free" services such as NetBeans and Google Code.

Money is also gracefully accepted!  Proceeds go to maintaining modern Windows, Linux, OS X workstations to test on and to occasionally take my family out to dinner.

Most feature requests should go through the [http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/issues/list bug tracker].  Additionally, if you have a specific feature request for jZebra that needs to be expedited (e.g. 1 month turn-around), I'll happily quote a price and usually respond the same day.  I can have an estimate prepared with a few days.  I am willing to work on a per-job or per-hour basis.  I will honor contracts as well (so as long as they don't violate the project's goals or the GPL3 license).

All code changes/features added jZebra will comply with GPL3 license and be made publicly available in source (and binary) to the general public.  Documentation on the wiki will generally lag behind 1 month.

All donations, requests or even just a "hello" or "thanks", please email me:  tres.finocchiaro@gmail.com.  I'm happy to hear that jZebra helped you, and I enjoy having a strong network of developers to turn to.
