jZebra has been in development since 2008 and exists solely because of the market need for a browser-based printing application in the shipping and retail worlds.

[http://tinyurl.com/5soepwo] If you find jZebra useful and beneficial for your company, you may consider donating.  There is no obligation to donate.  Donations will be used to take my wife to dinner, as development costs are minimal thanks to NetBeans (development platform) and Google Code (web hosting).

Additionally, if you have a specific feature request for jZebra that needs to be expedited (e.g. 1 week turn-around), I'll happily quote a price for said feature.  I usually can respond the same day with a quote, and also will work on a per-hour basis.  Lastly, I will honor contracts so as long as they don't violate the open nature of jZebra nor violate the GPL licensing. :)

That said, all code changes/features added jZebra will comply with GPL license and be made publicly available in source (and binary) usually in days following development and testing.  Documentation of said code changes/features usually lag in release days (or weeks) behind.

All donations or requests, email:  tres.finocchiaro@gmail.com
