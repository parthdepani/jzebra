#summary Setting up raw printing on OSX 10.8

If you are unsure if you need raw printing, please read here first:  [WhatIsRawPrinting]

= Background =

These steps will allow a USB or Network attached printer to receive raw commands through a Safari web browser on OSX.  This will also work for any 64-bit capable browser, such as Firefox that can run Java applets.  At the time of writing this, Chrome for OSX is 32-bit only and will not work with Oracle Java 1.7 64-bit runtime.

The sample.html provided with jZebra is intended to run from the local file system, however Oracle Java will not run the applet unless it is hosted from a web server.  [http://www.mamp.info MAMP] is recommended for this, which will run a portable web server on your Mac Desktop.  Installing and configuring MAMP is outside the scope of this tutorial.

= Steps =
  # Visit [http://java.com/verify/] to confirm Java is installed and running properly
  # Optional:  Enable the Java console in System Preferences, Java, Advanced, Java Console, Show Console (Highly recommended for web developers)
  # Open a Terminal window: *âŒ˜+space, `terminal`, enter*
  # Enable CUPS web interface by entering this into the Terminal <br>*{{{sudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes}}}*
  # Load Safari to *[http://localhost:631]*  and click The "Administration" tab, then "Add Printer"<br>
  # If you see your USB raw printer in the listing *DO NOT* select it.
  # Click *AppSocket/HP JetDirect*, Continue.
  # You will be prompted for a port
   * For USB printers type: (Example)<br>*{{{usb://Zebra/LP2844}}}*<br>Get this port by issuing the command *`lpinfo -v |grep usb:`* from the Terminal.  You don't need the "?location=1a200000" information.
   * For network printers type: (Example)<br>*{{{socket://192.168.254.254:9100}}}*<br>The IP address may be configured to use a different address, which is outside of the scope of this tutorial.
