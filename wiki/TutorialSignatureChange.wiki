= Prerequisites =

  # First, must have a OpenSSL private key used to obtain purchased signing certificate
  # Second, must have a purchased signing certificate (i.e. Verisign, Thawte, Geotrust)
  # Installed and working Java JDK + NetBeans bundle (i.e. [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html NetBeans 7.0, JDK 1.6.x])
  # Installed and working [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jdk5-jsp-142662.html JDK 1.5.x]

= Steps =
  # If not already, install the latest bundled version of Java Development Kit & NetBeans taking defaults. Registration is optional and can be skipped.
  # Register the older 1.5 JDK using Tools, Java Platforms, Add, and navigate to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_22 (or latest).
  # Open the project in NetBeans using the following steps:
   * Download the latest [http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/downloads/list?q=label:NetBeans jZebra source]
   * Extract the contents to the NetBeans project folder (Usually "My Documents/NetBeansProjects", or "home/NetBeansProjects") in a folder called "jZebra"
   * With NetBeans open, import the project using File, Open and browse for the newly created "jZebra" folder.
   * In the top left "Projects" pane, you should see a red coffee cup with the word "jzebra" next to it.
    || *Note:*  If "Projects" does not appear in NetBeans, hit CTRL + 1 to make it visible. ||
   * If jzebra appears to be in error (exclamation mark), you may need to change the target platform to the correctly installed JDK: Right-click "jzebra", Properties, Libraries.  Click "JDK 1.5" (if installed) or "JDK 1.6 Default". Click OK.







= Keep Unfinished =

  # By default jZebra uses "jzebra.ks" for it's KeyStore.  To use an alternate KeyStore, drag it in to the "Files" panel.  
    || *Note:*  If "Files" does not appear in NetBeans, hit CTRL + 2 to make it visible. Alternately, you can copy it to "NetBeansProjects/jZebra" ||
   # The KeyStore requires four fields: A file name, a store password, a key password and an alias name to be entered.  The compiler will do this automatically so as long as the values are defined in "NetBeansProjects\jZebra\nbprojects\jnlp-impl.xml" as `jnlp.signjar.keystore`, `jnlp.signjar.storepass`, `jnlp.signjar.keypass`, `jnlp.signjar.alias` respectively.
    || *Note:* Be careful as not to break the formatting of the html file. ||

   # Find your newly created and signed JAR file in your source folder in a folder called "dist" ("NetBeansProjects\jZebra\dist\jZebra.jar")
   # Deploy the new jar to a test web location.

= Change Applet Branding =

If you are NOT using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate root certificate] to sign jZebra it (Verisign, Thawte, etc), here are the steps to simply change the publisher name when prompted by the Security Dialog:

  # Download the [http://netbeans.org/downloads/ latest version of Netbeans] (The *Java SE* version is sufficient).
  # Install Netbeans taking defaults.  Registration is optional and can be skipped.
  # Download the [http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/downloads latest source code]
  # Extract source to a folder.
  # In Netbeans, click:  *Project --&gt; Open Project --&gt; &lt;browse to the extracted source code&gt;*  The icon should look like a red coffee cup.
  # On the left "Projects" pane, *Right Click* the red coffee cup "jZebra" and click *Properties*
  # Click *Application* from the list on the left.
  # Change vendor from "Tres Finocchiaro" to &lt;Name of Company&gt; and click OK to close the dialog.
  # Click the [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9hmP3Ho0t14/S3CbTCYXxqI/AAAAAAAAAY4/AOvjXs3cgec/s400/Picture+10.png] Hammer + Broom icon to do a clean build.
  # Find your newly created and signed JAR file in your source folder in a folder called "dist".
