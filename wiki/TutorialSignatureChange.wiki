#summary Change the digital signature of jZebra so the security warning does not say "Tres Finocchiaro".
#labels Phase-Support,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This explains how to change the digital signature inside jZebra for re-branding purposes.

= Details =

If you are NOT using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate root certificate] to sign it (Verisign, Thawte, etc), here are the steps to simply change the publisher name when prompted by the Security Dialog:

  # Download the [http://netbeans.org/downloads/ latest version of Netbeans] (The *Java SE* version is sufficient).
  # Install Netbeans taking defaults.  Registration is optional and can be skipped.
  # Download the [http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/downloads latest source code]
  # Extract source to a folder.
  # In Netbeans, click:  *Project --> Open Project --> <browse to the extracted source code>*  The icon should look like a red coffee cup.
  # On the left "Projects" pane, *Right Click* the red coffee cup "jZebra" and click *Properties*
  # Click *Application* from the list on the left.
  # Change vendor from "Tres Finocchiaro" to <Name of Company> and click OK to close the dialog.
  # Click the [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9hmP3Ho0t14/S3CbTCYXxqI/AAAAAAAAAY4/AOvjXs3cgec/s400/Picture+10.png] Hammer + Broom icon to do a clean build.
  # Find your newly created and signed JAR file in your source folder in a folder called "dist".

*Note:* If you choose to use a real certificate, you would be performing some additional steps which include (I believe) modifying the *jnlp-impl.xml* file to reference a dedicated keystore file (It's an ugly road of java signing if you do it this way, but works better with a corporate signing structure).
